  Chocolate eggs everywhere and not a drop to spare!  




  We're going on an Easter Egg Hunt. Yep. That's right. Because why the heck not?!  




  But this isn't just your typical hunt. More details to come soon but get your Bunny Onesies ready!  You'll need one to "hop" into before going on this hunting party adventure!  Food and adult beverages will be provided for a small donation from each guest invited. Yes, this is *invite only* so stay on top of your inboxes, as you'll have ONE WEEK ONLY to respond once selected. Then, if no response, I'll move on to the next guest on my list for a total of 12 lucky winners!


  Let the countdown begin to the Easter Egg Hunt of the year presented by OVER THE MOON!
datetime: 2022-04-10T17:00:02.740Z
