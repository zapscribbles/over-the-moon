  Let's read queer-themed books together!


  Introducing the OTM LGBTQ+ Book Club! 


  This is a very low-key reading club where I'll pick a book/theme for the month and whoever wants to join in, please do so. Then, I'll set a date and time for us all to meet up at a local brewery or coffee shop and we'll all chat about the book and drink some tasty beverages. 


  UPDATED 5.2.22 THE FIRST THEME IS "FIRSTS." 


  For at least as long as there is an interest, I will choose my first LGBTQ+ Themed book I read and then anyone in the club can put in your first LGBTQ+ themed book. Then, I'll pick at random one of those books and we'll read/discuss it for the next meeting!


  The first book I have chosen for us to read is She's Come Undone by Wally Lamb. I read this book around 2002 or 2003, after I was still in college or maybe had just graduated. I had just realized my truth in the last two years and was still working on "coming out of the closet" so I had only told a few close friends. No family at that point. So my memory serves me that this book really resonated for me at that time. I haven't read it since then so it's going to be very interesting to see what I think of it after twenty years! I don't even know if it would still be relevent or P.C. or anything so apologies ahead of time if any of it doesn't relate to you or is offensive. It was written in the 90s.  I do think it will be interesting to see other viewpoints. I hope you enjoy it! And it's okay if you don't. I welcome all opinions as long as we are all respectful. :)
