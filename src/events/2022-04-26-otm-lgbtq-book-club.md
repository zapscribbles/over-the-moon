  Let's read queer-themed books together!


  Introducing the OTM LGBTQ+ Book Club! 


  This is a very low-key reading club where I'll pick a book/theme for the month and whoever wants to join in, please do so. Then, I'll set a date and time for us all to meet up at a local brewery or coffee shop and we'll all chat about the book and drink some tasty beverages. Sometimes, we'll even have fancier food! OOh! haha

  **I am so excited to announce the OTM LGBTQ+ Book Club Meeting: Round 2!**  


  Here's the scoop:


  Book: *Moon in Full* by Marpheen Chann


  Where: Coffee by Design @ 1 Diamond Street Portland Me


  When: 7.30.22 2pm-4pm


  BONUS: Marpheen, himself, will be there! In fact, he has stated that he would love to answer any questions any of y'all may have after reading his book.  


  Coffee by Design is selling Marpheen’s book at the Diamond Street location but it is also available at all of our amazing local bookstores like Print, Sherman’s, and Longfellow Books!


  Marpheen is a local Maine resident, gay, and a first-generation Asian American born in California to a Cambodian refugee family and later adopted by an evangelical, white working-class family in Maine, Marpheen uses a mix of humor and storytelling to help people view topics such as racism, xenophobia, and homophobia through an intersectional lens.-taken directly from his website. You can read more about him on his website: here: <https://www.marpheenchann.com/>


  I am incredibly excited for this one and hope to see as many of you there as possible because this is not one you'll want to miss! Please RSVP by July 25th if at all possible.
