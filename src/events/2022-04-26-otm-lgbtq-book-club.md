  Let's read queer-themed books together!


  Introducing the OTM LGBTQ+ Book Club! 


  This is a very low-key reading club where I'll pick a book/theme for the month and whoever wants to join in, please do so. Then, I'll set a date and time for us all to meet up at a local brewery or coffee shop and we'll all chat about the book and drink some tasty beverages. Sometimes, we'll even have fancier food! OOh! haha 


  M﻿eeting #1 in the books as of June 2022. We had a wonderful time at Foundation Brewery in Portland, Maine. We discussed The Price of Salt by Patricia Highsmith (they made a movie called "Carol" that was adapted from this book. It starred Cate Blanchet and is a phenomenal movie but very different from the book).  The book is amazing as well!

  I am very understanding of the fact that we all come from different backgrounds and some of us may have even dealt with a lot of past trauma. I have my own childhood trauma that I experienced soI know first-hand that it can be hard to watch or read certain genres so I have put the triggers below in case any of you want to bow out.  I respect your decision. 


  Trigger warnings: alcohol consumption, violence, murder, depression, mania, self-harm, blood, gore, gaslighting, intimate partner violence (emotional, verbal, physical), sadomasochism, drug use (mentioned), sexual assault (mentioned). 


  For those of you who do want to participate, please RSVP no later than October 15th if at all possible so I can be sure to set everything up accordingly. Austin street has very tasty beers for those of you who like the occasional drink. For those of you who do not drink beer and/or alcohol: [Austin Street Brewery non-beer and non-alcoholic options](https://www.austinstreetbrewery.com/fox-street-menu). 


  This book was published in January of 2021 but it seems like only kindle is available immediately right now. I can't find any local libraries or bookstores who have it so I apologize but I am too excited to read this to wait! haha


  Here are places you can pre-order the book, as it is going to be released on October 4th.  That should still give us all plenty of time to read it! Yay!
