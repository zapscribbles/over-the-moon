  Let's read queer-themed books together!


  Introducing the OTM LGBTQ+ Book Club! 


  This is a very low-key reading club where I'll pick a book/theme for the month and whoever wants to join in, please do so. Then, I'll set a date and time for us all to meet up at a local brewery or coffee shop and we'll all chat about the book and drink some tasty beverages. Sometimes, we'll even have fancier food! OOh! haha 


  M﻿eeting #1 in the books as of June 2022. We had a wonderful time at Foundation Brewery in Portland, Maine. We discussed The Price of Salt by Patricia Highsmith (they made a movie called "Carol" that was adapted from this book. It starred Cate Blanchet and is a phenomenal movie but very different from the book).  The book is amazing as well!


  S﻿tay tuned for the next meeting!  (not September 21st---website is under construction)
