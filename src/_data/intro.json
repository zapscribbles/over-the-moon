But there is one thing that remains the same...it is always shining bright above, illuminating even our darkest of nights.**\n\n**Therefore, it is with great pleasure that I invite you to an \"Over the Moon\" experience. Because in the end, we don't have to be alone. Now, more than ever, we need each other. And when we are together, that's when the magic happens. So let's come together for more than just a good time. Let's go beyond that. Let's go Over the Moon!**\n\n**Over the Moon brings people together for shared interests such as dancing, book clubs, comedy, business networking, themed events such as mystery murder dinner theatre, drag shows, holiday events, birthday parties, game nights, & more! You can often expect a collaborative effort with local venues, artists, and performers with tasty food, delicious adult beverages & Mocktails. My goal is to keep all events free or donations only and I will have a minimum of 1 % of all proceeds donated to an organization I am passionate about and the rest will go towards the cost of future events. So the more donations, the more I can donate and the bigger the events!  All good times for a good cause. So what are you waiting for?**\n\n**Carpe diem and let's GO!**\n\n**Been to one of my events? I would love to hear from you. I am ALWAYS looking for ways to improve. Feedback encouraged -** [**click here![](https://g.page/r/CTksFDGxpiHfEAg/review)**](https://g.page/r/CTksFDGxpiHfEAg/review)"
